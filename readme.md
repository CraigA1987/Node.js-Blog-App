New -GET - Show new object creation form
Create -POST - Create a new item, then redirect somewhere
Show -GET - Show all info about specific object /:id
Edit -GET - show edit form
Update -PUT - Update a particular item then redirect somewhere
Destroy -DELETE -Delete a particular object, then redirect somewhere
